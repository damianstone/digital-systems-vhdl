/*

If the [rising_edge(clk)] line is removed, the process would not be sensitive 
to the rising edge of the clock. In that case, the process would execute on every 
change in the clk signal, not just when there is a rising edge. 

This would likely result in incorrect behavior for a flip-flop or register, as the values would be updated 
more frequently than intended, possibly causing unpredictable behavior in the circuit. 

The rising edge condition ensures that the process responds specifically to the rising 
edge transitions of the clock signal, which is a common requirement for modeling flip-flops 
or registers in VHDL.
